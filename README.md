Project:

Data 902 Sentiment Analysis Project
The goal of this project was to apply various natural language processing techniques to a corpus of documents. 
These techniques consisted of producing word clouds based on various n-grams, using a lexicon to apply sentiment
to the documents, and running an emotional analysis on the corpus.

Data:

The data used in this project was taken from reddit.com. The data consisted of various features from reddit posts 
made in February of 2018. The full data contained about 10 million rows but a subset was used. The data used was a
subset by one single section of reddit, the technology subreddit. The sentiment analysis was then performed on the 
titles of all of these posts. There were about 10,000 posts used in the analysis.

Visual outputs from code shown in report file.
